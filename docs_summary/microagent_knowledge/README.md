## Available Knowledge Files

1. [Add Agent](add_agent.md) - Knowledge for adding new agents to the system
2. [Docker](docker.md) - Docker-related knowledge and commands

9. [Swift on Linux](swift-linux.md) - Knowledge about Swift programming on Linux

## Purpose

These knowledge files serve as specialized information sources for microagents, allowing them to provide domain-specific expertise without requiring the main LLM to have all this knowledge in its context window.
